# Solar System Dynamics

## Introduction  
This repository contains code for some simple astrophysical systems using numerical integration and approximation algorithms.    

Each model has various parameters which the user should tweak according to the requirement:  

All the models (except Kirkwood gaps) are implemented in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/). All constants and planetary inforamtion is fetched from Google. Visualization of the models through simple web app is implemented using [matplotlib]([https://matplotlib.org]) library.  

This implementation was done as project work on the [Krittika Summer Progamme](https://krittikaiitb.github.io) as a summer project.

## Project structure  
In this repository you will find:  

- Elliptical Orbit.ipynb - Code for simulating an elliptical orbit around a massive heavenly body.   


## How to run code?
The easiest way is to simply copy the code from the repository into any jupiter notebook and tweak the model parameters. Make sure you have the latest verison of [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/) to get accurate results
